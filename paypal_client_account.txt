problem solutions
-------------------------------------------------
I was facing a similar problem in Django 1.10 and none of the above solutions worked for me.

What eventually worked was running this command:

python manage.py migrate --fake myappname zero
This reset all migrations (to the zeroth state)

This followed by :

python manage.py migrate myappname
